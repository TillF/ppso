0.9-894
still an issue with resuming from projectfile, probably affecting all optim_*

0.9-893
caught unexpected behaviour when a slave returns a result that is apparently not needed (*_robust) - reason still unclear

0.9-892
fixed initialisation bug introduced in 0.9-89

0.9-891
improvement in plot_optimization_progress

0.9-89
fixed numerous bugs concerning resuming optimization with dds*

0.9-88
updated docu; improved plot_optimization_progress; fixed bug concerning resuming optimization with dds*

0.9-87
unified structure of DDS and PSO-projectfiles (PSO's didn't contain function_calls)

0.9-86
included plot_optimization_progress (stand-alone and integrated into optim_*); excluded init_visualisation

0.9-85
for serial DDS: added options for resuming interrupted calibration runs (not fully tested yet)

0.9-84
optional error catching in optim_pso, optim_ppso_robust, optim_pdds_robust

0.9-83
allows the specification of working directories for the slaves
fixed bug in formatting output of logfile in optim_pdds

0.9-82
fixed faulty import of project file when recommencing run that lead to corrupted results
check existence of lhs package

0.9-81
parallel DDS: probability of decision variable to be included is computed based on the max number of function calls allotted to the thread, not the total number

0.9-8
fixed severe DDS-bug (error in probabilty of decision varibale to be included)
added DDS-pre-search (initialisation)
minor clarifications

0.9-7
introduced parallel DDS
fixed bug in DDS (overreflection)
introduced max_number_function_calls
fixed bug concerning existence of logfile
revised docu

0.9-6
included simple DDS
included more and corrected sample functions for testing

0.9-4
fixed bug in particle initialisation (wrong ranges, missing X_lbest)
ensure that no particle stands still

0.9-3
Support of break file.
Heeding of parameter_bounds.
Fixed error in logfile formatting.

0.9-2
Support of project file and log file.
