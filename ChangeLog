- improved visualisation (active and best position, connection lines); modularised

0.9-921
- computationally irrelevant: handled 0 execution times in plot_optimization_process

0.9-92

- *: introduced optional timeout check for very slow or stuck slaves
- correction of termination criteria (confusion iteration vs. function calls)
- dds: removed duplicate logging of model calls
- dds: corrected counting for function calls of pre-runs

- optmization of sample functions


0.9-894
still an issue with resuming from projectfile, probably affecting all optim_*

0.9-893
caught unexpected behaviour when a slave returns a result that is apparently not needed (*_robust) - reason still unclear

0.9-892
fixed initialisation bug introduced in 0.9-89

0.9-891
improvement in plot_optimization_progress

0.9-89
fixed numerous bugs concerning resuming optimization with dds*

0.9-88
updated docu; improved plot_optimization_progress; fixed bug concerning resuming optimization with dds*

0.9-87
unified structure of DDS and PSO-projectfiles (PSO's didn't contain function_calls)

0.9-86
included plot_optimization_progress (stand-alone and integrated into optim_*); excluded init_visualisation

0.9-85
for serial DDS: added options for resuming interrupted calibration runs (not fully tested yet)

optional error catching in optim_pso, optim_ppso_robust, optim_pdds_robust

fixed bug in formatting output of logfile in optim_pdds

0.9-82
fixed faulty import of project file when recommencing run that lead to corrupted results
check existence of lhs package

0.9-81
