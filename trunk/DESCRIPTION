Description: (Optionally parallelized) optimization using PSO (Particle Swarm Optimzation) or DDS (Dynamically Dimensioned Search) algorithms, which excell for multidimensional (multi-parameter) functions with many local extrema and a restricted number of function evaluations. The parallelized version builds on Rmpi and is intended for highly computationally intensive objective functions (>20 s evaluation time).  -- experimental version, use with care. Comments welcome --
Depends: R (>= 2.8.0)
Suggests: Rmpi (>= 0.5-7), rgl, lhs
