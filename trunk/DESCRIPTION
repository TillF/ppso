Description: The ppso-package, (Parallel) Particle Swarm Optimization, provides optimization capabilities for a given objective function f in R. It adjusts the parameter vector p to produce a minimum value of f. \nThe PSO and DDS (Dynamically dimensioned Search) algorithms especially excell for multidimensional (multi-parameter) functions with many local extrema and a restricted number of function evaluations. The parallelized version builds on Rmpi and is intended for highly computationally intensive objective functions (>20 s evaluation time).  -- experimental version, use with care. Comments welcome --
Depends: R (>= 2.8.0)
Suggests: Rmpi (>= 0.5-7), rgl, lhs
